# Cancer_driver_mutation_Tool
The mutDriver Analyzer is a machine learning-based tool that predicts potential cancer driver mutations. This tool also identifies co-occurring mutations and uses global LC-MS/MS PTM data from PhosphoSitePlus to find cancer-associated mutations that disrupt PTMs. If given user inputted data, the MutDriver Analyzer can also estimate how likely a given mutation is to be a cancer driver.
